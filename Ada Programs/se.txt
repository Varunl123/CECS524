What went right?

We were successfully able to implement  one module of project i.e ., estimation of traffic in an location based on Zip code and weather conditions.
We have created a database which stores previous data (traffic history). We can now able to retrieive the traffic report based on this data.

What worked well?

-> Each memember in the team has contributed his part and were able to justify what they have done. 
-> For any project to be successful , team work and collaboration is necessary and we were successful in bringing these traits to the table.
-> We were able to develop the module and test it with all the necessary test cases where most of them were successful attempts and the ones which were unsuccessful , we were able to rectify the code.

What was found to be particulary useful?

-> We were able to successfully analyze a Traffic Monitoring System with different requirements and user stories.
-> There are many real time services which does traffic monitoring system such as Google maps, Apple Maps, Yahoo maps. We as a team learned how these services generate traffic reports which such large chunks of data.
-> While working on this project, we got insights on how the predective analytics are used in real time.


Project Highlights:

-> In Traffic monitoring application, we were able to analyze differnet requirements and use cases such as Map Interface, Directions, Estimated time, traffic data etc.
-> Used git as project management tool , it helped the developers to work through branching and merging.
-> Learned server side scripting in the proecess of implementation of a module in the project.
-> Learned about project documentation and its versioning.
